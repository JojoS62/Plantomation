\chapter{SD Card}
The SD card is connected via SPI and is necessary for normal operation. If no SD-Card is present, no channels can be activated for control.

\textbf{control.xml}

Contains information about the channels and their oepration. Names, humidity thresholds and the states (enabled/disabled) are stored here for the ESP to act upon and to display in the web interface. The log\_enable keys can be used to enable or disable logging for this channel.\\
Default is enabled, errors will always be logged. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{wifi.xml}

Contains all necessary information for wifi-usage, like SSID, password and if the ESP should be in station mode (client inside existing network), or in AccessPoint-Mode (creating its own network). Default is AP-Mode.

\textbf{Logfiles}

If logging is enabled, the ADC-values (hourly) and watering-events will be logged. This way long-term data about the moisture and water usage can be obtained for further fine-tuning.
